    <h1>OpenMensa RSS Overview</h1>

    <p>
        In this directory the OpenMensa RSS files are served.
    </p>
    <p>
        They use the same canteen ID as the OpenMensa API does.
        For instance the TU Wien canteen has ID 1098 and is served at <a
            href="https://schicho.github.io/openmensarss/1098.xml">https://schicho.github.io/openmensarss/1098.xml</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
        To save bandwidth not all canteens available on OpenMensa are converted to RSS. In case you want to add one,
        you can add the respective canteen ID to the code at <a
            href="https://github.com/schicho/openmensarss">https://github.com/schicho/openmensarss</a>.
